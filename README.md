# Powerlifting Data Science Project

As a trainer and fan of the field, I started the project to see what can be deduced from the high-level competitors that I might be able to predict for the local competitions myself as an amateur. 
 - The data are taken from kaggle and provided by [ https://www.openpowerlifting.org/ ]
